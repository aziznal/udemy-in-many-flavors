# Udemy (clone) in many flavors

This repository is my playground for experiments with different frontend technologies.

### What this is:

- a way for me to learn why anything other than Angular exists
- something better to do than re-watching naruto
- an outlet for me to go clickity-clackity on the keyboard
- an excuse for me to learn (neo)vim
- me showing off


### What this doesn't aim to be:

- meant for someone to learn from it
- 100% production-ready
- performant
- as fancy or feature-rich as the real udemy (I wouldn't dream to do it alone)


## The Backend

The backend is written in NestJS. It has its own README if you're interested in it.

Maybe I'll write the app in different backends eventually, too. Probably not, but, maybe though.


## The Frontends

I've always wondered what makes different frameworks special. I got tired of wondering so I thought why not take a stab
at creating the same app in many different frameworks, starting with the one I know the best: Angular.

I plan on making frontends in the following frameworks:
- **Angular** (my highest experience)
- **React** (moderate experience)
- **Vue** (no experience)
- **SveltKit** (barely tried it)
- **Quik** (no exp)
- **Solid** (no exp)
