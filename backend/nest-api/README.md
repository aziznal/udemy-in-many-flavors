# Udemy Api 

This is an api for the udemy frontend(s) written with nestjs using postgreSQL and exposing a REST api.

## Running the thing

- `npm start`: start nest in watch mode in the `development` environment (meaning you need a `development.env` file
  under `config/env`)


## Environments
- Two envs are configured: `production` and `development` (see npm scripts in package.json to see how to run each)
